Usage:
    To build:
        make
    To run:
        ./image_editor
    To use:
        To load the image from a file:
        	LOAD <file name>
        To select all the image or a part of an image:
        	SELECT ALL
        	SELECT <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>
        	(where (x1,y1) are the coordinates of top-left corner
        	and (x2,y2) of the bottom-right corner)
        To show the histogram for a gray image:
        	HISTOGRAM <number of stars per bin> <number of bins>
        	(number of bins needs to be a power of 2)
        To rotate a selection of the image (square or whole image):
        	ROTATE <angle>
        	(angle needs to be a multiply of 90, even negative)
        To crop an image using a selection:
        	CROP
        To apply a kernel over a selection of a color image:
        	APPLY <TYPE>
        	(where TYPE can be EDGE, SHARPEN, BLUR or GAUSSIAN_BLUR)
        To save the edited image in a file:
        	SAVE <file name> [ascii]
        	(ascii for text file, nothing for binary file)
        To open an image:
            OPEN
        To convert an image from color to grayscale:
            CONVERT
        To mirror an image:
            MIRROR
        To apply sepia filter to color image:
            FILTER
        To exit the program:
        	EXIT

Files used:
    - image_editor.c - main file;
    - menu.c/.h - functions used for menu implementation
    - utils.c/.h - functions used in the program;
    - commands.c/.h - functions that do a certain command in main;
    - read_print.c/.h - functions used for reading and writing the image;
    - my_alloc.c/.h - functions that use malloc and free for dynamic
    		      allocation of memory;
    - my_defs.h - includes all the macros and structs made;
    - Makefile - build and clean rules.

Algorithms used:
    - rotation of a matrix
    - histogram, equalization, application of edge detection, sharpen, blur
    and gaussian blur for an image
    - sepia filter

General idea:
    
    The program represents an image editor that works in the Linux terminal. It
    can use NetPBM format images, meaning it can edit P2, P3, P5 and P6 images.
    The user can load an image from a file, edit it in a number of ways, save it
    in a file and then maybe open it.

    Every memory allocation is followed by some defensive programming code to
    ensure the safety and security of the data.
